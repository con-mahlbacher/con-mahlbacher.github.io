</h2>
<p>
    This is a simple python script that scrapes college soccer match data from the web and calculates elo ratings for every division 1 men's 
    soccer team based on this data. At the moment, it prints out all the game results followed by a ranking with each team. I am currently 
    working on putting this onto this website and improving the user display.

</h2>
<p>
    This is an extensive object-oriented project in python. It simulates four years of international men's soccer tournaments. This is very 
    much a work in progress.

<p>I worked for three years as a high school math teacher after college. Now I am seeking opportunities in software development in the 
    Boston area or remote. I am especially interested in back-end development in Python, Java, or C++, but I am eager for any opportunity to 
    challenge myself in new fields. I have a computer science degree and I have worked on personal projects to keep up those skills and gain 
    new ones. During my time as a teacher I developed tremendously as a communicator, a leader, and an organizer, which I know will help me 
    succeed in any industry.
