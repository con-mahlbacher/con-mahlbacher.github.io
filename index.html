<h3>
    This is a simple python script that scrapes college soccer match data from the web and calculates elo ratings for every division 1 soccer
    team based on this data. At the moment, it prints out all the game results followed by a ranking with each team. I am currently working on
    putting this onto this website and improving the user display.

<p >This is my website. I am looking for a job. I worked for three years as a high school math teacher out of college, but now I 
    am seeking opportunities in software development. I have a computer science degree and I have worked on personal projects to keep up
    those skills and gain new ones. During my time as a teacher I developed tremendously as a communicator, a leader, and an organizer.
