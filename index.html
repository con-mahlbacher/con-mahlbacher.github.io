<p >This is my website. I am looking for a job. I worked for three years as a high school math teacher out of college, but now I 
    am trying to work as a software developer of some sort. I was very good at this in college but I have limited professional 
    experience as a developer. On the plus side, I learn very quickly and I have great communication skills. This website is new, 
    so if it looks terrible at the moment, check back soon! I am mostly using it to practice things I haven't looked at in a while.
    Like HTML, CSS, Git, and more.
